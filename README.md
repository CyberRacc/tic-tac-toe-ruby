# Tic Tac Toe | Ruby

Here's my final tic tac toe project written in Ruby for The Odin Project.

## What the game includes

- A game board that is displayed to the user.
- The ability for the user to input their move.
- The ability for the computer to make a move.
- Checking if a move is valid.
- Checking if the game has been won after each move.
- The ability to play again after the game is over.

## What I learned on this project

How to manage a project with multiple classes and trying to stick to a single responsibility principle. I also learned how to use a module somewhat.

How to properly instance classes and refactor code when there's too much responsibility for one class.
